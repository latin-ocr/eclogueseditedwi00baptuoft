the first is due to the beginning of Mantuan‘s third (1-37)‚
and the punning allusion to Bishop Alcock (p. 5) is adapted
from Mantuan's allusion to Falcone de' Sinibaldi (IX,
213 ff.). The beginning of the second repeats a passage
from Mantuan's second (1-16) 3 the beginning of the fourth
reminds one of Mantuan's ninth (117-119) and tenth
(137-141‚ 182-186) ,· and toward the close of the fifth
(p. 45) there is a passage which comes from Mantuan’s
second (66-78).

In Barclay's ‘ Prologe,’ too, there is an interesting parallel
to a passage in Mantuan's dedicatory epistle. This epissse,
dated 1498, begins with a playful riddle:

Audi, o Pari, aenigma perplexum, quod Oedipodes ipse non sol-
ueret. ego quinquagenarius et iam canescens adolescentiam meam
reperi, et habeo adolescentiam simul et senectam.

The explanation is, that in the previous year he had found a
certain youthful composition of his own, consisting of eight
eclogues and, “ab illa aetate‚'' entitled Adolescentia. And
now he sends it forth again, in revised and augmented
form. But history repeats itself‚ and it was not long before
Barclay could report a similar experience:

But here a wonder, I fortie yere saue twayne
Proceeded in age, founde my first youth agayne.
To finde youth in age is a probleme diffuse,

But nowe heare the truth, and then no longer cause.

And now he too has “made the same perfite ”—

one of Barclay's editors as “ very curious‚’' Publications of the Percy
Sociely, XXII, 43. It is cited also in the Dictionary os National
Biograplzy (s.v. Alexander Barclay) as a proof that Barclay's Egloges
were written at Ely.

54 It is interesting to notice that Professor ten Brink found in
these lines the explanation of a peculiar quality of Barclay’s Egloges,
namely, their combination of the freshness of youth with the maturity
of manhood: “ So erklart es sich. wenn diese Dichtungen in hoherem
