ECLOGUE IV. 81-100 131

The usage was criticized by Mantuan’s contemporaries, but his
brother Tolomeo could cite the authority of Laurentius Valla and
Gregorio Tifernate (Apologia, Lyons ed„ 1516, fol. Ee, iv).

81. Umber means Gregorio Tifernate (Gregorio da Citta di Cas-
tello), as Mantuan himself explained to Thomas Wolf, Jr.‚ in the
year 1500: ‘Eg0‚ mi Iacobe, sicut multa alia ita hoc praecipue
quaesivi, quid ipse in aeglogis suis intelligi desyderaret per Vmbrum,
in cuius laudibus esset tam frequens ac assiduus. Aiebat ipse a se
notari Gregorium tiphernum praeceptorem suum,' etc. (Letter to
Jakob Wimpfeling, Feb. 24, 1503, printed in the Tiibingen edition
of the Edogues, 1515). Gregorio was born about 1414. He studied
at Perugia, and afterwards spent some years in Greece. Returning
to Italy, he taught Greek at Naples‚ where (c. 1447) he had Gioviano
Pontano as one of his pupils. From 1449 to 1455 he was in the
service of Pope Nicholas V, for whom he made translations of
several Greek works. After the death of his patron (March 25,
1455) 116 taught for a short time at Milan: and toward the close of
1456 he went to France, to the court of Charles VII. On Jan. 19,
1458, he was appointed professor of Greek at the University of
Paris; but early in September, 1459, he returned to Italy. From

April, 1460, to December, 1461, he seems to have taught at Mantua, '

and the remainder of his life was spent at Venice. He seems to
have died about 1464. [The unpublished ‘Vita' of Gregorio, Cod.
Vat. Lat. 6845, foll. 157-161, contains very little information be-
yond what may be gleaned, or inferred, from his own poems. Some
additional facts are furnished by F. Gabotto, Ancora un letterato
del Quattrocento (1890), pp. 7-23: L. Delaruelle, Melanges d’
archeologie et d’ histoire, xix (1899), 9-33; L. Thuasne, Roberti
Gaguini Epistole et Orationes (1903), i. 10-12].
