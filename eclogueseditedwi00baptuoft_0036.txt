he quotes a sample passage, thirty-nine lines from the close of the
second book: “Sylva vetus Dodona timet, gemuere Molossi Ι rura
soli‚’' etc. There is a MS. copy of this letter in the Library of the

to the year 1478.]

'³⁰ Published at Bologna in 1481—“ Bononiae aeditum iii. id. Feb.
M.CCCC.LXXXI,'' as is stated at the end of the poem in the Bologna
edition of 1488—but doubtless circulated before it was “published”,
like Shakespeare’s “ sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends.'’ The
Apologeticon which is prefixed states that the author has consented
to publish it, “longis precibus expugnatus.'’ [This poem also is
mentioned in Sabadino's closing novel.]
