LIFE OF MANTUAN 17

of the Mantuan Reform.22 In 1515 he was appointed
Apostolic Legate to arrange peace between Francis Ι and the
Duke of Milan 32³ but he was prevented by age and infirmity
from undertaking this mission. He died at Mantua, March
20, 1516.24 He was beatified December 17, 1885.25

In form and feature Baptista was not very handsome or
imposing. One of his admirers who visited him in the year
1500 can only say, with Odysseus, that “ the gods do not give
every gracious gift to all, neither shapeliness nor wisdom nor
skilled speech '' 26—“seias id rectissime posse de Baptista
dici quod Homerus et ceteri vates de Ulysse rettulerunt, qui
corpore parvus et forma indecorus sed ingenio maximus et
animo speciosissimus fuisse perhibetur.’' 2⁷ So Luca Gaurico
calls him “parvus et modicae staturae‚'' in his T ractatus
Astrologicus.2⁸ And Bandello says that he was very ugly:
⁴¹ era brutto come il culo, e pareva nato dai Baronzi.’⁷ ²⁹

The Baronzi were a Florentine family, proverbial for their homely
features. Bandello’s lively description is hardly borne out by the
surviving portraits of the poet. There are at least three busts os
him at Mantua; and these suggest only a rather benevolent coun-
tenance with a very prominent nose. One is a contemporary portrait
in terra-cotta. now in the Museo Patrio; another is a large bust, in
bronzed wood, now in the Palazzo degli Studi (it was transferred
thither “ex aede Carmelit.'⁷ in 1783); while a third may be seen
above the poet’s tomb in the Cathedral. There is another very in-
teresting bust, in bronze, in the Royal Museum at Berlin; this is
beautisully reproduced for an article by W. Rode, Jqlcrbuclp der
