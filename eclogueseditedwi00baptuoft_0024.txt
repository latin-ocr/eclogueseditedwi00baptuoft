16 INTRODUCTION

But he probably spent most of his remaining life at Man-
tua.²⁰. On May 22, 1513, 110 was elected General of the
entire Carmelite Order; and he seems to have held this
office till his death.²² During his brief term of office he
consolidated the congregation of Albi, a Freneh imitation

catalogue of the monastery library at Bologna: “indicem bibliothecae
vestrae Bononiensis, si id tuo commodo fieri potest ’' (Ioannis Pici
Mirandulae Concordiae comilis opera, Bologna, 1496, foll. 145, 150).
And Mantuan’s reply to this second letter is dated at Bologna, Oct.
1, 1490 (quoted in the Bologna edition of his collected poems, 1502).

²⁰ In 1493 (Oct. 22) he delivered a funeral oration at Mantua, on
Leonora d' Aragona, the mother of Isabella d' Este (printed copy 111
1110 Biblioteca Comunale at Bologna). In 1494 (Oct. 29 and Nov,
27) and in 1495 (Jan. 3) he writes to the younger Pico della Miran-
dola from Mantua (J. P. Mirandulae opera, Bologna, 1496, foll.
164, 161, 161b). [J. H. Lupton, Life of Dean Colet, 1887, p. 67,
says that Colet may have met with Mantuan “in Paris, where (ac-
cording to Trittenheim) he was staying in 1494.”] Ι11 November,
1496 110 seems to have been at least temporarily absent from Mantua,
for his oration In funere Ferrandi Regis was delivered by his
friend Pietro da Novellara (Luzio-Renier. op. cit.‚ 69). In 1497 he
was in Florence. as the dedication of his Eclogues states: “anno
praeterito, cum Florentia rediens Bononiam pervenissem,’' etc. In
1500 he was at Mantua: “'Ego dum Bononiae ingenuis disciplinis
vacarem in ipso iubileo anno profectus sum Mantuam, ut Baptistam
‘quem ex libris noveram coram quoque viderem,‘' etc. (Letter of
Thomas Wolf. Jr., to Jakob Wimpfeling, Feb. 24, 1503). In Au-
gust, 1504, a letter of Isabella d’ Este promises to send to Giovanni
Sabadino “ sei sacchi di frumento ''; and the gift is to go to Bologna
in charge of the “ R.‘¹⁰ frate Bapf‘· Spagnolo” (S. von Arx, Roman.
Forsclz„ xxvi. 813). On July 1. 1506, 110 wrote to his brother Tolo-
meo: “In questo tempo di questo nostro exilio ho fatto trascrivere
tutte 10 nostre cose nove ’' (F. Gabotto, Un poeta beatificato, 1892,

p. 17).

²1 Ventimiglia. Hist. Chron. General. Carm., Naples, 1773, p.
171. Many ancient and modern accounts say that Mantuan soon re-

· signed his high office—because his reforms were opposed, or 111 order

to devote himself entirely to literature. Possibly the tradition is based
upon a remark by Seb. Murrho, in the presace to his eommentary
on the first Partlzenice: “audivimus ex Conrado Leontorio, quo a
secretis familiariter utimur. magistratu se quem in eo ordine sum-
mum gessit abdicavisse. ut liberius humanis divinisque litteris vacare
posset.” This presace is not dated, but it was printed in 1513 (at
the beginning os Ascensius’ Paris edition), and it may have been
taken to refer to that year. But Murrho died in 1495ς and his re-
port must refer to Mantuan’s office os Vicar-general, not to his
office of General at all.
