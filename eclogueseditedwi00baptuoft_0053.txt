1, 47 ,· Ι, 108. The chapter on Artificial Allurements of
Love quotes three passages: Ecl. 1, 1043 1, 733 1v‚ 218.
And the first of these is introduced as very familiar matter;

ἑ 1andh Galla's sweet smile quite overcame Faustus the
ep erd:

me aspiciens motis blande subrisit ocellis.’'

. The section on Beauty as a Cause of Love-Melancholy
quoteS, and translates, Ecl. 1, 48-51, “ludit amor sensus‚''
eto:

Love mocks our senses, curbs our liberties,

And doth bewitch us with his art and rings,

I think some devil gets into our entrails,

And kindles coals, and heaves our souls from the hinges.

Other scattered quotations in the earlier part of Burton's
work are, Ecl. 1, 7131, 1743 1, 613 v, 46.

Indeed, some of Mantuan’s phrases are repeated so often
that they have earned a place in our dictionaries of Latin
quotations. So, in particular, the “semel insanivimus
omnes‚’' of Ecl. 1, 118, which has acquired a special interest
from a passage in Boswell’s Life of Johnson.-

When I once talked to him of some of the sayings which every
body repeats, but nobody knows where to find, . . . he told me that a
he was once offered ten guineas to point out from whence Semel in· W Κ
sanivimus omnes was taken. He could not do it3 but many years 5 .

42 The first nine were translated into English fourteeners by
George Turbervile, in 1567. And this translation was reprinted in
1572, 1594, and 1597. “The whole ten Eclogues did not find a trans-
lator till 1656 when Thomas Harvey published a version in de-
casyllabic couplets'’ (Walter W. Greg, Pastoral Poelry and Pastoral
Drama, London, 1906, p. 78).
