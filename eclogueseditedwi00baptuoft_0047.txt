the King's School‚ Durham, in 15933 ²³ they were in use in
the Free School of St. Helens, c. 1635; ²⁴ and they were
recommended for the third form in Charles Hoole’s ,Vew
Discovery of tlze Old Art os Teaclzing School‚ 1660:

For Afternoon lessons on Mondayes and VVednesdayes let them
make use of Mantuanus, which is a Poet, both for style and matter.
very familiar and gratefull to children, and therefore read in most
Schooles. They may read over some of the Eclogues that are less
offensive than the rest, takeing six lines at a lesson. which they
should first commit to memory, as they are able, etc.25

And as Hoole records, they were used in the Rotherham
Grammar School (in the fourth form) before he became
head master:

For asternoon lessons they read Terence two dayes, and Mantuan
two dayes, which they translated into English, and repeated on Fri-
dayes, as beforessss

Julius Caesar Scaliger complained that some teachers actu-
ally preferred them to the Eclogues of Virgil: “ hoc prop-
terea dico, quia in nostro tyrocinio literarum triviales quidam
paedagogi etiam Virgilianis pastoribus huius hircos praetu-
lere.’‘²⁷ There is a similar complaint in the preface of
Thomas Farnaby’s edition of Martial, London, 1615:
“ quando ipsis paedagogulis Fausta precor gelida sonet altius
quam Arma virumque cano.’' And Dr. Samuel Johnson
states that “ Mantuan was read, at least in some of the
inferior schools of this kingdom, to the beginning of the
present century.’' ²⁸

25 This was an exercise in “metaphrase,’' T. Spencer Baynes, op.
cit., 186. Professor Baynes says (p. 161) that Hoole's New Dis-
covery “was not published till 1659, but, as the title-page states, it
was written twenty-three years earlier.'’ Professor Watson says,
“published in 1660, written twenty years earlier.''
