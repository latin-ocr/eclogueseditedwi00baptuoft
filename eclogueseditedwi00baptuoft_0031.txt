PA TRONS ΛΝΒ FRIENDS 23

And he had other good friends at Mantua, in Paride
Ceresara,⁴9 Baptista F iera‚⁵⁰ Andrea Mantegna ⁵¹ and Mario
Equicola.⁵² But he had already made many friends in
Bologna, and Florence, and Rome. At Bologna, he owed
much to Gio. Baptista Refrigerio and Lodovico Foscarari
(who have been mentioned above, p. 12),⁵3 and he was on
intimate terms with the novelist Sabadinof'4 with Count
Andrea Bentivoglio,⁵⁵ Antonio Fantuzzi⁵⁶ and Filippo
Beroaldof'} Of friends made at Rome, we have already
mentioned Filippo Baveria, Falcone de’ Sinibaldi and

the Turk. And a letter from Gioviano Pontano, June Ι, 1499, sug-
gests that Mantuan had tried to enlist his aid in celebrating the ex-
ploits of his patron: “de principe vero tuo illustrando, bonam tibi
promittere voluntatem possum; verum quid promittat, cui nihil om-
nino est quod det in penu? non deero tamen virtutibus fortissimi ac
magnanimi ducis ’⁷ (printed in the Bologna edition of Mantuan’s
collected poenis, 1502). The new Catlzolic Encyclopedia (ΙΙ, 276)
states that it was “through the exertions of his former disciples,'⁷
the Marquis and the CardinaL that Mantuan was elected General
of his order.

Refrigerio, see L. Frati, Giorn. stor. d. lett. ital„ ΧΗ, 327-8, and 5.

tuan's pupil.

54 To whom he wrote a Consolatio on the death of a son (1485),
Silvae, I, 7. Mantuan is introduced in very complimentary fashion
in the closing novel of the Porrellane. See, further, S. von Arx, op.
cm, 771.

non solum familiariter noverim sed etiam habuerim confessorem?
See, also, Mantuan's poem De reditu Philippi Bet-oaldi iuvenis litera-
tissimi ex Gallia (Silvae, VII, 4).
