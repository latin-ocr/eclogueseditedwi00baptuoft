42 INTRODUCTION

ideots.'' And iu the :Inatomic os Absurditie (1589), Nashe
has his allusion to the fourth Eclogue:

To this might be added Mantuam inuectiue against them, but
that pittie makes me refraine from renewing his worne out com—
plaints, the wounds wherof the former sorepast feminine sexe hath
felt. 1, but here the Homer os women hath forestalled an obiection‚
saying that Mantuani· house holding os our Ladie, he was enforced
by melancholie into such vehemencie of speech, and that there be
amongst them as amongst men, some good, some badde, etc.³⁵

The story of Amyntas, Ecl. 11-111‚ is introduced, as thor-
oughly familiar matter, in the first eclogue of Francis
Sabie's Pan's Pipa (1595), ll. 76-93.36 And it seems to be
alluded to 111 Thomas Randolph’s Eclogmr occasioned by
Two Doctors disputing upon Predestination:

Love-sick Amyntas, get a philtre here,
To make thee lovely to thy truly dear.

The motto of one of Bishop Hall's Satires (1598), vl, l,
“Semel insanivimus,” coines from Ecl. 1, 1183 and in the
same satire we have the lines,

As did whilere the homely Carmelite,
Following virgil, and he Theocrite.

an inaccurate reference to a passage in Robert Greene‘s Mamillia
(ed. Grosart, 11, 107) : “I would correct Manluans Egloge, intituled
Alplzus . . . sor surely though Euripides in his tragedies doth greatly
exclaim against that sexe, yet it was in his choller, and he infered
a generall by a particular. which is absurd. He had an euyll wife,
what then?'' Mr. McKerrow explains Nashe's phrase “Mantuans
house holding of our Ladie'’ to mean “his wise having the upper
hand os him. and ruling his household,'' and quotes Ascham’s Sclzole-
masler (ed. Wright. p. 205), “ is thc house hold os our La(ly.'' And
he very justly insists that (li-eene is here referring to the wife of
Euripides, “and not to Mantuan's wise at all.'' There is a bit os
gossip in one os the novels of Bandello (111. 52) which offers a little
different explanation os Mantuan’s bitterness: “Intendo anche che
il mio compatriotta, il poeta carmelita, ha satta un' ecloga in vituperio
delle donne, ove generalmente biasima tutte le donne. Ma sapete cib
che ne dice Mario Equicola segretario di niadama di Mantova? 1⁴:in
afferma che il nostro poeta era innamorato d' una bella giovane, e
che ella non lo volle amare; onde adirato compose quella maledica
ecloga '' (quoted by Luzio-Renier‚ op. cit., 66).
