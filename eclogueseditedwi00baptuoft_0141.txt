Δ.) ‘nobilissimo e„in ogni sorta di lettere dottissimo.’ He translated the
Aulularia for the Bishop Lodovico Gonzaga, and perhaps also a
Greek comedy. And he had some knowledge of Hebrew. In his

hence the mention os him by Luca Gaurico: ‘erat facie et barbitio
rufus, procerae staturae, sed proportionatus; ex Iove in horoscopo
cum Marte ditissimus et locuplex; habebat aedes regias; ingeniosus,
legum professor, in litteris latinis et graccis eruditus. Quum senec-
tutis limina fuit ingressus, incepit dare operam astrologiae.² He was

ECLOGA 1, ΓΑ σεῖσςῇ

Antiquos repeti vult Fortunatus amores,·
Obsequitur Faustus referens conubia laeta*

At Fortunatus' request, Faustus repeats the story of his love,
courtship, and marriage—the story of an honorable love and its happy
ending. This eclogue (with various details added from the second,
third, and fourth) is imitated in the first ‘eglogue' of Francis
Sabie⁷s Pan’s Ptpe (1595).

phrase occurs in the Ecloga leeoduli‚ 248.

4. modoznunc‚ as at ii. 151, v. 35, viii. 102, 114, ix. 202, x. 72.
So osten in the Ecclesiastical Writers and in the Latin Bible: e. g.‚
John, ix. 25, ‘scio quia, caecus cum essem, modo video!

pergam, Ι et vacet annales nostrorum audire laborum3' Geor. iv.
