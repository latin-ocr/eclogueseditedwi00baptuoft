up the page, and, besides, the reader may be glad to have
the Eclogues printed, for once, so that he can see more than
a few lines at a time. Ever since Ascensius published his
long-lived commentary they have regularly been printed
with alternate stretches of text and notes on the same page.

Ι hope that most of my obligations to earlier writers are
duly acknowledged in the footnotes. My Introduction is
much better than it might have been because of the gener-
osity of Mr. HENRY WALTERS‚ of Baltimore‚ who allowed
me the free use of hisv magnificent private library of Italian
incunabula. And it is further enriched by material which
I was able to collect last summer during a vacatiori tour
of the great public libraries of Italy. lt gives me pleasure
to recall the uniform courtesy and kindness which Ι re-
ceived from various library officials in Turin, Milan,
Mantua, F errara, Bologna, and a dozen other cities. And
Ι am glad to say here that my book owes a great deal to
Cav. ALESSANDRO LUZIO, Director of the R. Archivio di
Stato at Mantua. From one of his published papers Ι
had learned most of what I have written about our poet‘s
family, and by his special knowledge and ready helpfulness
he made my own work at Mantua both profitable and

pleasant.
