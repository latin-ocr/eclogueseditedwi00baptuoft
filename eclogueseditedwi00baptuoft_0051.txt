The motto at the end of 'l'lzrcc Pastoral Elegies, by* Wil-
liam Basse (1602), is taken from Ecl. 1, 9-10:

quando vacat, quando est iucunda relatu,
historiam prima repetens ab origine pandam.

Ecl. V, 63-64:

sidera iungamus, facito mihi Iuppiter adsit;
et tibi Mercurius noster dabit omnia faxo,

is the motto on the title-page of Thomas Middleton’s
Familic af Low (1607). And Ecl. 111, 87, “regia res amor
est‚” is set in like manner on the title-page of Richard
Brome's The Queenes Excluznge.

The phrase “semel insanivimus omnes,” Ecl. Ι, 118,
served as the motto of Samuel Nicholson's Ac‘olastus lzz's
Α fter-wilte (1600) 3 3⁷ and it is quoted in T Ιιι1 Rctztrn from
Parnassus (printed in 1606), IV, 2.

The quotation in Wily Beguiled (printed in 1602),³⁸
“optatis non est spes ulla potiri‚'' comes from Ecl. 1, 53.

In Drayton’s Owl (1604), the playful mention of the
lark,

And for his revel-enee, though he wear a cowl,

alludes to Ecl. VII, 4,

bardocucullatus caput, ut campestris alauda:

and the passage in the same poem,

O moral Mantuan, live thy verses long,
Honour attend thee, and thy reverend song!
Who seeks for truth (say’st thou) must tread the path
Of the sweet private life .....
For adulation, but if search be made,
His daily mansion, his most usual trade.
Is in the monarch’s court, in princes' halls,
VVhere goodly zeal he by contempt enthralls, etc„
