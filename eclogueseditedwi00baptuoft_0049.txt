And the whole line appears as a motto on the title-page

In Robert Greene's T ritameron of Leve (ed. Grosart, 111,
100) there is a mention of “Mantuam principle . . . that
weal is neuer without woe, no blisse without bale, ech sweete
hath his sower, euery commodity hath his discommodity an-

of Euripides in his Tragedies, the tants of Martiall, and
prime quippes of Propertius, are more of course then cause,

The “semel insanivimus omnes '’ of Ecl. 1, 118, is twice
quoted by Thomas Nashe——in the Prologue to Summers
Last Will and Testament (1600), and in Have witlz you to
Saffron-Walden (1596) : “and he replied with that wether-
