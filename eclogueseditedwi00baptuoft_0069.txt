SYNTAX. METRE, VOCABULARY 59

SYNTAX

One interesting bit of syntax is the use of the simple
subjunctive after a verb of thinking: credo . . . concitet et
. . . tollat, Ι, 50-51, puto sidera tangant, VIII, 44. Another
is the use of putare, credere, or aestimare, with a simple in-
finitive, apparently on the analogy of verbs of “ hoping '⁷
or “ expecting '': grande aes conflare putabam, III, 753 qui
flectere divos Ι creditis, III, 141-23 et vertere in aurum Ι
aestimat, VI, 133-4. Facere is used with the infinitive, in
the sense of “to cause to'': V, 58, IX, 221. Intendere
(Ξ animum intendere) is used with the dative, 1, 106 , 11, 49 ,
subintrare, with the accusative, I, 176, IV, 90, secundare,
with the dative, V, 29, obviare, with the dative, Ix, 147.
The use of mood and tense with dum is largely a matter of
metrical convenience : cp. 1, 25, dum mens erat, VII, 147-8,
dum . . . obstaret. . ‚dum tepet ac timide insanit,· VIII, 19,
dum . . . castraret, VIII, 120, dnm . . . perlegerem, IX, 55,
licuit dum ,· X, 96-7, dnm viximus una, Ι dum . . . fnit.
