50 ΙΝ TRODUC'I'ION

[n 1563 wc have eight English eclogues by Barnabe
Googe. Here again the model is Mantuan, though there
is very little verbal imitation or borrowing in detail. The
lines at the close of Ecl. vm,

and Phoebus now deseends‚
And in the Clowdes his beams doth hyde.
which tempest sure portends,

corne from the close of Mantuan's third,

et sol se in nube recondens.
<lum cadit. agricolis vicinos nuntiat imbres.

And perhaps the ram whose battered condition symbolizes
his owner's fortunes (Ecl. 111) should be compared with
Mantuan’s ram, Ecl. lx, 46-47:

hic aries, qui fronte lupos cornuque petebat.
nunc ove debilior pavidoque fugacior agno est.

Spenser‘s Slchlzcards calendar (1579) owes a large debt
to Mantuan, especially in the eclogues for July, September,
and October. This was pointed out by F. Kluge. Anglia.
ιιι, 266-274, and O. Reissert, ib. lx, 222-2243 and it is now
set forth in C. H. Herford's edition of the poem. Perhaps
one further parallel should be suggested: compare ‘Octo-
ber.' loo-101,

The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes ⁵⁵
Α· ἴθ’ ’ἐμὴ Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell,

with Ecl. V, 18-19,

Grade als andere Werke Barclay‘s jugendliche Frische mit miinn-
licher Reife in sich vereinigen” (Geschiclzte der englischen Litter-
atur, Strassburg‚ 1893, 11, 455). And Barclay's borrowed experienee
is still accepted as fact in the new Cambridge History os English
Literature¹ 111 (1909), 62.

⁵⁵‘E. K) says that lino loo “imitateth Mantuanes saying, ‘va-
cuum curis divina cerebrum Poscstff’ But the ‘saying’ is hard to
find: it is not in the Bologna edition os the collected poems. 1502.
or in Ascensius‘ edition. Paris, 1513, or in the later poems published
at Lyons in 1516,
