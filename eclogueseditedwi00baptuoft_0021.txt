LJFE oF MANTUAN 13

ipse quoque in silvis et vallibus Appennini
exilem ducens tecto sub paupere vitam
delitui qua templa petit Romana viator

et qua Flaminios fugiens Claterna per agros
ducit ab angustis undosum vallibus amnem
arce sub Ociami, nostris ubi dieta Camenis
tecta Refrigerius sublimi in colle tenebat.⁹

In 1479-80 he held the office of Prior at Mantua.²⁰ In
1483 he was elected Vicar-general of the Carmelite Congre-
gation of Mantua.¹² And to this office he was re-elected
five times—each time for a period of two years, with an in-
terval of four years—in 1489, 1495, 1501, 1507, 1513.12

The first term of his office and the first interval were

spent mainly at Rome, on the business of his Congrega- —

tion.1³ The city was disturbed by the Orsini and Colonna

10 Florido Ambrogio, op. cit., 43, who adds that he was appointed
tutor of the Marquis Federico's children. On Jan. 23, 1479, he wrote
to his friend Refrigerio from Reggio, explaining that he had fled
from Mantua because of the plague; on Jan. 29, 1480, and Feb. 16,
1480, he wrote to him from Mantua. In 1476 (Apr. 28 and July
21) and in 1478 (Aug. 12) he had written to the same correspondent
from Bologna. In 1481 and 1482 he seems to have been again in
Bologna. The first Parthenice was published at Bologna, Feb. 11,
1481, and in the same year Refrigerio could call himself Mantuan's
pupil: ‘⁴ ipse, qui eius disciplinas quotidie haurio '⁷ (L. Frati‚ Giorn.
stor. d. lett. ital„ XII, 327-8). On Oct. 8, 1482, and Nov. 2, 1482,
he wrote to Caesar Napeus, of Brisighella‚ from Bologna. [There
are manuscript copies of the letters mentioned in this note in the
Library of the University of Bologna]

Π “Congregationis Mantuanae Observantium Carmelitarum Viear-
ius,'' as he calls himself in his prose account of the Santa Casa at
Loreto (Sept. 22, 1489). In 1413, three Carmelite convents, Le
Selve (near Florence), Gerona, and Mantua, agreed to correct certain
abuses which had crept into the order; and this combination de-
veloped into the Congregation of Mantua, or Mantuan Reform. In
1442, it achieved quasi-autonomy under a vicar-general. By Man-
tuan's time, it had brought under its authority several other houses
in northern Italy, Novellara, Modena, Ferrara, etc.

1³ The Epigrammata ad Falconem were written during this period,
and so were some of the Silvae. In the Epistola contra Calum-
niatores he says, “dum Romae sub Sixto quarto agerem '’ (Lyons
ed„ 1516, fol. Aa, vi); and Florido Ambrogio records (op. cit„
