and he afterwards studied philosophy at Padua.⁴ About
1406 he entered the Carmelite monastery at Mantua.⁶ In

1472 he was appointed ‘¹ lector '’ in the monastery of San
Martino at Bologna.⁶

During his term of service there his monastery was visited

by the plague;⁷ but he was sheltered and nursed by a
wealthy friend in the city, Lodovico Foscarari:

Nuper in cenobium nostrum dirae pestilentiae immisso veneno toti
urbi coeperamus esse timori; pellebamur non a colloquio tantum
verum etiam a conspectu hominum . . . interclusi eramus nec ulla
videbatur evadendi via: omnia mortem intentabant . . . tu cum Re-
[rigerio nostro . . . spem vitae confirmasti, xenia misisti, in amplas

ac magnificas aedes tuas hospitio me suscepisti, lautissime et ele-
gantissime pavisti.⁸

And he afterwards found a refuge at the villa of Gio. Bap-
tista Refrigerio‚ “on the upper waters of the torrent Cla-
terna, on the way to Rome’':

Gregorio seems to have been in Mantua from April, 1460, till
December, 1461; Merula, from 1460 till 1463. Gregorio was the
‘⁴ Umber ’⁷ of the Eclogues (iv, 81, 95 ff., 246 sf.; v, 101; vrr, 103 lx,
200), as Mantuan himself explained to Thomas Wolf, Jr., in the
year 1500. See note on Ecl. iv, 81. Cf. also the Apologia written
by the poet's brother Tolomeo: “Gregorium Tiphernatem quem
poeta noster habuit praeceptorem '’ (Lyons ed„ 1516, fol. Ee, v), and
a letter written by Mantuan to Pico della Mirandola, the Younger,
Jan. 3, 1495: “mors Georgii Merulae primum condiscipuli postea
praeceptoris mei (nam sub Gregorio Tiphernate commilitavimus) tris-
titia me affecit '' (loannis Pici Mirandulae Concordiae Comitis opera,
Bologna ed„ 1496, fol. 161b).

4 See the dedication of his Eclogues: “ante religionem, dum in
gymnasio Paduano philosophari inciperem.’'

⁵“ Religio placuit iuveni.” etc., Vitae suae Epitome. Thtz date
usually given, 1464, seems to be too early. The first eight Eclogues
were written “ante religionem ’'; the fourth laments the death of
Gregorio Tifernate; and Gregorio seems to have lived at least tiu
1464.

tistae Mantuani, Turin, 1784, p. 28. In the title of the De vita
beata (printed in 1474) he is called “professor '’.
