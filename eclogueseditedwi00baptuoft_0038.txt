30 INTRODUCTION

Trithemius (writing in 1494) mentions also an Introduc-
torimn subtilis Scoti. a book os “orationes elegantissimae‚'’
an Apologia. pro s. Petro (in three books)‚⁰⁵ and “epistolae
multae ad diversos.’⁷ Some of his later works (printed at
Lyons in 1516) were, Tractat-us de loco conceptionis
Clzrist1‘.⁹⁰ De causa diversitatis inter interpretes sacrae scrip'-
turae, Epistola contra calumniatores, Dialogus contra de-
tractores,⁰⁷ Contra eos qui detrahunt ordini Carmelitarum
apologz'a.⁹⁸

HIS POPULARITY

He wrote with the greatest fluency and rapidity‚⁹⁹ and is

even said to have published more than 55,000 verses. He
tells us himself that his poem on the Blessed Virgin—a
poem of about 2900 lines—was the work of two years,

5

“duorum annorum lucubratio 3’ and that his 2100 lines on
St. Catharine of Alexandria were written in forty days—
merely by way of improving the time in an enforced sum-
mer vacation.¹⁰⁰ But in spite of this rapid production his
writings were very popular, and he was hailed by many of

Pietro da Nox-ellam, and asks that it be printed. The fact is, that
the composition of the De Patientia extended over a considerable
period of years,

⁰⁵ Pietro da Novellara, who had been charged with heresy (Florido
Ambrogio, op. cit., 79). The discovery. at Mantua, of another un-
published work. Tractatus de sanguine Christi (1492), is reported in
the Analecta Bollandiana, xm (1894), 71-72.

⁰⁰ Written in 1503: Donesmondi. Dell' Istoria Ecclesiastico di
Mauram. vol. ii (Mantua, 1616), p. 93.

”T Dedicated “ad Ptolemeum Gonzagam‚” i. e., aster Jan. 6. 1507
(S. Davari, op. cit„ 10).

⁰⁸ Dedicated to the Cardinal Sigismondo. “eiusdem ordinis pru·
tectorem.'’ i. e., not earlier than 1508 (Donesmondi, op. cit.. 11, 110).

Μ’ “ I‘oema omne carptim composui, cursim absolvi, non fere aliter
quain canes aiunt bibere in Aegypto '’ (Epistola contra Calumniatores.
Lyons ed.. 1516, sol. Bb, vi).

¹0⁰“ Quadraginta enim et non amplius (liebus opus absolutum est.
dum propter aestivum iustitium negotiis intermissis curamus otia
canicularia salubriter curn aliqua studiorum fruge transigere.'' So.
too, his three books on Dionysius the Areopagite were written in a
year: “lucubrationi huic annum impendi.”
