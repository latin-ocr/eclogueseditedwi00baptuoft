As a member os a monastic order—Frater Baptista Man-
tuanus—our author never calls himself hy his family name.
He was the son of Pietro Spagnolo, a Spanish nobleman
from Granada. who had himself lost his family name os
Moduer (or Modover) and received the name Spagnolo.
from the name os his own country.³⁰ His father, and his
grandfather, “Antonius Cordubensis,''³¹ took part in the
nava] battle off (laeta in 1435—when Alfonso V of Aragon
was defeated 11)· the Genoese. Being taken prisoner along
with their king, they spent some time at Milan: and they
remained in Italy after Alfonso was released:

Hesperios inter proceres quos invida laudi

in praedam fortuna dedit tum prima ferebat
Alfonso sub rege merens Antonius arma

cui genus et patrium dederat sua Corduba nomen. .
ipse pium casus dominum comitatus in omnes

venit ad Insubres ubi. postquam vincula passo
affuit Alsonso melior fortuna, relictus,

seu fuerit casus seu caeli immobile fatum.
egregium decus et nomen sibi fecit in armis.³2

busts are ‹loubtless more reliable than the* rude woodcut which
adorns the Lyons edition of Mantuan’s later works, 1516, the
frontispiece os the Cologne edition of the Eclogues, 1688, or the
highly idealized portrait which appears in the biography by Florido
Ambrogio‚ Turin, 1784.

“⁰“ Petrus Spagnolus.'’ as he is called in the title of the De vila
beata. 1η his epitaph (in the Carmelite church at Mantua) he was
called “Petrus Sp. Modover '³ (quoted in d’Arco's MS. history, in the
R. Archivio di Stato at Mantua).

³¹ Cf. Baptista's oration In sunere Ferrandi regis (printed at
Brescia in 1496) : ‘¹ sub hoc Alsonso avus meus Antonius Cordubensis
in Italiam venisse et meruisse se narrabat, curn ego adhuc puer senem
admirarer more veteranorum militum sui temporis bella recitantem.”
In the Troplmeum pro Gallis expulsis. Bk. v (Bologna ed., 1502,
fol. 374b), he says of his brother Tolomeo:

proavos secunda virorum
magnanimorum altrix et mater Corduba vatum
huic dederat, proavos armis et sanguine claros.

So Paulus Jovius says “ex Hispaniola gente honesta'' (Elegia
virorum literis illustrium. Base] ed„ 1577, p. 117).
