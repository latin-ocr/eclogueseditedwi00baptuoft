40 INTRODUCTION

In 1579, Thomas Lodge could say, in his Dcsencc os
Poetry: ⁴‘ Miserable were our state yf we wanted those
worthy volumes of Poetry: could the learned beare the losse
of Homer? or our younglings the wrytings of Mantuan?”
And so Drayton tells us that, when he expressed a boyish
wish to become a poet, his tutor

And first read to me hofflsgimMantum,
Then Virgil's Eelogues.²·³

It will be observed that Shakespeare’s quotation from Man-
tuan is put into the mouth of a schoolmaster3 and it may be
suggestive for our estimate of Holofernes' learning that he
quotes the first line of the first Eclogue—as it were, the
opening phrase of his F irst Latin Reader. At any rate, the
same phrase is used to indicate a very little learning in one
of Gabriel Harvey's gibes at poor Greene: “he searched
euery corner of his Grammer-schoole witte (for his margine
is as deepelie learned as Fausto precor gelida).'' ³⁰ And it
is used in the same way in one of the pleasant tales of Bona-
venture des Periers: “ 11 y avoit un prebstre de village qui
estoit tout fier d'avoir veu un petit plus que son Caton.
Car il avoit leu De Syntaxi et son Fauste precor gelida.’' ³¹

QUOTATIONS FROM THE ECLOGUES

And this common use as a school-book may help to ex-
plain some other references in English, French, and Ger-
man authors.

Ecl. 1, 118 is quoted in Stephen Gosson⁷s Sclzoole of
Abuse (1579): “Now if any man aske me why my selfe
haue penned Comedyes in time pastea, and inueigh so egerly
against them here, let him knowe that Semel insanivimus
omnes.³²

Ecl. 1, 52, “ nec deus, ut perhibent, Amor est‚'' is quoted
