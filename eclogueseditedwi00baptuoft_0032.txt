Oliviero Carasa, Cardiual os Naples3 aud to these we should
add Pomponius Laetus‚⁵⁸ Gio. Gioviauo Pontano,⁵⁰ and per-
haps also Alessandro Cortese ⁰⁰ and Petrus Marsus.⁰1 At
Florence, he had very distinguished friends in Pico della
Mirandola (both the uncle and the nephew) and Angelo
Poliziano; and his correspondence shows that his friendship
with these men (as with Beroaldo) was not merely a formal
matter, but something very, real and intimate.

In a letter to Mantuan, Jan. 13, 1490, Pico answers a
request for the loan of a copy of Philostratus: “en tibi
Apollonium, quem si tuae virtuti, tuis in me officiis non de-
berem, deberem certe vel his litteris quibus eum efflagitas.
tantus in illis amor, tanta humanitas.’' ⁶² In a second letter,
Mar. 20, 1490, he has to speak of a passage of Philostratus,
and of a passage in the Book of Genesis:

de Apollonio Thyaneo nihil sentio magis quam quod tu sentis, super
qua re scribam ad te plura, cum erit otium, et quae tibi erunt fortasse
non ingrata. de diversitate translationis nostrae a littera Hebraica
in tertio capite libri Geneseos, ubi de Eva agitur et serpente, sic
equidem censeo, etc.

⁶⁸ To whom the Epigrammata ad Falconem profess to have been
submitted for criticism. In the Epistola contra calumniatores he is
called “mihi familiarissimus '³ (Lyons ed„ 1516, sol. Aa, vi).

⁵⁰ Pontano is mentioned in complimentary sashion in the second
book of the Tropltaeum, where Fame carries the news of Fornovo to
King Ferdinand, “Pontanique ora poetae ¹ accipit.'’ His letter to
Mantuan already cited begins: “Et initae Romae memor sum ami-
citiae, et ingenii tui excellens vis momentis paene singulis id efficit
ut doctrinae vel summa etiam cum admiratione meminerim tuae. an
eius ego obliviscar? quem Latinae Musae non memorabilem modo
verum maxime etiam admirabilem ct nostris faciunt et facturae sunt
saeculis.’' He adds that he is sending some samples of his historical
work, and will send some os his other compositions later. And Man-
tuan acknowledges the receipt os some of these poems in Silvae, VI,
1. Pontano is mentioned also in Tolomeo's Apologia: “erat enim
ille vir poetae nostro sic addictus, sicut constat ex eius epistolis, ut
eum loeo numinis habere videretur ’' (Lyons ed.‚ 1516, fol. E, e).

⁰⁰ those death he bewails in a poem addressed to Hermolaus Bar-
barus, Silvae, vm, 2. Chevalier’s Repertoire (Paris, 1905) puts Cor-
tese’s death in 1499. But Hermolaus Barbarus died in 1493.

⁰¹ Mantuan wrote a six-line epigram on his oration In die Sancti
Stephani primi martyris, describing it as “breve sed magnae re-
ligionis opus.'' And it was through his recommendation that the
speech was printed at Rome, c. 1490.
