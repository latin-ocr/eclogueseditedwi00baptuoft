Other members of the family were Berardo, whom Baptista
could recommend to the Marquis (Nov. 10, 1494) as ‘⁴ del
corpo prosperoso et assai litterato et di bono ingegno;'' ⁴⁴
Cesare, who is mentioned in a document of Aug. 14, 1512,
as “spectabilis et eximius artium et medicine doctor;'’ and
a Dominican sriar (perhaps named Paolo) whom Baldessar
Castiglione found in Rome in 1519.⁴·'¹ There were two
sisters, Anna and Margherita. And still another brother
was Εςίᾱίοὲ6 who died in battle in 1509—when the Mar-
quis Francesco was surprised and captured in a night at-
tack, near Legnago:

in luctum, in lacrimas, longa in suspiria, quando
Aegidius frater nobis cum Principe raptus

ante diem, missus Princeps in vincula, frater

in tumulum, datus in praedam furialibus armis.⁴²⁷

known as Isabella d'Este), and the Cardinal Sigismondo.⁴⁸

⁴3 For the Marquis he wrote the five books Troplzaeum pro Gallis
expulsis (c. 1498) and a Carmen de fortuna F. G. (1509). To the
Marchioness he dedicated the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh Parthe-
