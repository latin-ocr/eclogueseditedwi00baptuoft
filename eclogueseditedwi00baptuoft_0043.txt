PUBLICATION OF THE ECLOGUES 35

COMPOSITION AND PUBLICATION OF THE ECLOGUES

The Eclogues are ten in number, making a total of 2063
lines. The author tells uS‚ in his dedicatory epistle‚ that the
first eight were written while he was a student at Padua‚¹2
and that the last two were added after he had joined the
Carmelite Order. He tells us, also, that he revised these
youthful compositions when he was about fifty years old 3
and we may be sure that this revision added much to the
value of the poems. But even after their revision he
seems to have regarded them as a rather frivolous and un-
important piece of work3 and he probably never dreamed
that his ten Eclogztes were to contribute more to his fame
and to his influence than all the rest of his 55,ΟΟΟ verses.

They were first printed, at least in their revised form, in
1498.13 They were very popular from the beginning, and
soon came to be widely read—not only in Italy, but in
France and Germany and England.¹4 They were imme-

¹2“ Quendam libellum meum quem olim ante religionem, dum in

gymnasio Paduano philosophari inciperem, ludens excuderam et ab
illa aetate Adulescentiam vocaveram?

¹3 “Mantuae Impraessum per Vincentifi Berthocu Regiensem Anno
dfii. MCCCCLxxxxvul. sexto decimo Kalendas Octobres,'’ etc. So the
colophon of a copy in the Bibliotecr Casanatense at Rome. [The
colophon of my own copy gives the same place, printer, and year,
but omits the day of the month.] The dedicatory epistle is addressed
to a friend at Mantua, and dated Sept. 1. Both Brunet’s [llanuel and
Graesse⁷s Trff'sor mention an edition printed at Poitiers in 1498; and
both Graesse and Hain cite even an edition with a few notes by
Joh. Murmellius printed at Strassburg in the same year. Graesse
calls the Mantua edition a reprint of the Poitiers edition; but there
was hardly time between Sept. 1 and Sept. 16 for an intermediary
edition to be printed abroad. Perhaps the date of the Poitiers edition
was only inserted from the date of the dedicatory epistle; a copy
described in Pellechet's catalogue gffne'ral, 1, 437, is “ S. d. (1498?).''
[The “adnotamenta⁷’ of Murmellius were included in a letter ad-
dressed to Paulus Ruremundensis (printed in full in a Deventer edi-
tion of the Eclogues, 1510). This letter is mainly a criticism of the
commentary of Aseensius; and was certainly written later than
1498]

14 They were printed at Erfurt in 1501, at Bologna, at Brescia,
and at Paris in 1502, at Venice and at Strassburg in 1503. at De-
venter in 1504, in 1505, and in 1510. at Tiibingen in 1511. at London
in 1519, etc.. etc. In 1504 they were printed at Florence, in a hand-
some Giuntine volume: “ Eclogae Vergilii. Calphurnii. Nemesiani.
Francisci Pe. Ioannis Boc. Ioan. bap. Ma. Pomponii Gaurici.”
