as Ascensius immediately explained it. And N iceron saw
in the “superba noverca ‘¹ a hint of the poet's illegitimate
birth.⁸⁴ But this interpretation hardly agrees with the
fact that his early treatise De vita beata is addressed to
his father in terms of affection: “ego enim qui te mihi
carior sit inter mortales habeo neminem.'‘

Baptista had many brothers and sisters.³⁵ The eldest‚
ΤοΙοῐηθο,86 became the confidential secretary of the Mar-
quis Francesco, and rose to such favor that he was even
allowed to take the name of Gonzaga.³⁷ But he grossly
abused this confidence—by forgery and fraud and traffick-
ing in justice—and after the death of the Marquis (1519)
he was forced to flee from the city.³⁸ Another brother was

nom de Pollux, des rigueurs et de la fierte': de sa belle-mere, qui ne
peut-&tre autre que cette Constance.”

Epithalamium (Antwerp ed.‚'1576, 111, fol. 302).

³⁰ Tolomeo seems to have been of illegitimate birth; and Baptista
himself may have been “ex damnato coitu natuS,'' as Paulus Jovius
puts it: S. Davari. op. cit.‚ 4-9. In the Epithalamium already
quoted, Baptista calls Tolomeo—and apparently himself—the son of
Costanza de’ Madi (or de’ Maggi), of Brescia:

haec est Maia domus pollens propagine tanta,
tot claris ornata viris; Constantia mater
hinc, germane, tibi nuribus praelata pudicis.

3¹⁷ By a decree of the Marquis, Jan. 6, 1507: S. Davari, op. cit..
10. In the dedication of the Dialogus conlra Detractores, and in a
letter os Mario Equicola (Nov. 10, 1508). he is called “Ptolemeus
Gonzaga.” At the close of the Dialogus, Baptista says of him: “ob
singularem sidem atque industriam in Gonzagarum familiam privi-
legio ascitus '² (Lyons ed.‚ 1516, sol. e, i); and Equicola has, “huic
cum Ptolemeus a secretis solus primus sit voluntatum et consiliorum
adiutor ct particeps.'’ ln the Tropliaeum pro Gallis expulsis, Bk. v
(a passage referring· to the year 1496), he is introduced as com-
sorting the Marchioness Isabella:

tristibus his curis aderat facundus et aeri

ingenio praestans iuvenis Ptolemeus
(Bologna ed.‚ 1502, sol. 374).

³⁸ Baptista addressed to him his sixth Parllzenice (on St. Apol-
lonia). a poem on the death of their brother Federico Antonio

(1506). a Dialogus contra Detracwres. and an Epistola contra Calum-
niatores. Tolomeo published a learned Apologia (antra detrahentes
operibus B. M. (e. 1509), and after our poet's death we find him ar-

ranging sor a worthy monument for him (LuziQ-Renier‚ op. cit.‚ 63),
