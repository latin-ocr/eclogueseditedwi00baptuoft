MANTUAN'S FAMILY 21

the Canon Alessandro, who is mentioned in a document of
December 1497 as judge in a law-suit between the youth-
ful Raffaello Sanzio and his stepmother. There he is called
“decretorum doctor '' and “vicario del vescovo urbinate.'⁷ 3²³
About 1507 he is made one of the speakers in the Dialogus
contra Detractores, and called “praeclarus iurisconsultus et
nostrae cathedralis ecclesiae canonicus.'' 4⁰ But Alessandro
became implicated in his brother⁷s frauds, and after their
exposure he joined the erring Tolomeo in Romesss There
is a pleasant glimpse of a third brother, Roberto Lucano, in
a letter written by Baptista to Tolomeo‚ Sept. 8, 1503. Here
it is reported that Roberto has returned to Mantua after
spending some time in the Levant, in the service of the
Venetian State. He has brought back a Venetian accent,
andra knowledge of spoken Greek, and all the air of a man
of the world. And now he wishes to return to Venice, and
hopes to go with the Venetian ambassador to the King of
Spain.42 Still another of this talented family—‘⁸ claris de

· tot mihi fratribus unum,’' as Baptista might well call him

—was Federico Antonio, who died of the plague in 1506.
This was the accomplished orator who had stood before
kings and princes, who knew all law and all histories, who
was loved of all the Muses, who spent his days and nights
in study, sitting among his books like a consul among the
senators and asking each in turn What advice or information
it could give:

lucra nihil curans, nihil emolumenta, sedebat
inter mille libros velut in coetu atque corona¹
mille senatorum consul, quid sentiat unus
quisque super rerum causis et orig-ine tota

luce rogans et nocte dorni, quam plurima chartis
lucubrata diu mandans studioque reponens

multa gravi, quae forte sequens mirabitur aetas.4³

39 Luzio-Renier‚ op. cit.‚ 62.

4⁰ In a decree of April 28, 1515, he is called “canonico mantovano
e consigliere del Marchese:⁷' S. Davari, op. cit.‚ 14.

41 Baldessar Castiglione had previously gone to Rome, to ask per-
mission to proceed against him: Luzio-Renier‚ op. cit.‚ 62.

4² Luzio-Renier‚ op. cit.‚ 62. In a decree of Oct. 17, 1511, he is
called “segretario marchionale'': S. Davari‚ op. cit.‚ 14.
