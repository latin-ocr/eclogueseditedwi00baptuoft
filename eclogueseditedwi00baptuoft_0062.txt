52 INTRODUCTION

a cento made up from the first four eclogues of Mantuan.⁶⁷
And in the third, Damon's ‘⁸ dittie ” of the “ stately progeny
of heardsmen '’ is a paraphrase of Ecl. vn, 9-39.⁶⁸

In Milton’s Lycidas, 128-129,

Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
Daily devours apace, and nothing said,

there seems to be an echo of Ecl. 1x, 141-147‚

mille lupi, totidem vulpes in vallibus istis

lustra tenent, . . .
. . factum vicinia ridet
nec scelus exhorret nec talibus obviat ausis3

and the abrupt close of the poem,

To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new,

reminds one of Mantuan’s closing line, 1x‚ 232,

Candide, coge pecus melioraque pascua quaere.

On Paradise Lost, vr, 871, “ Nine days they fell‚” the com-
mentators might perhaps quote Ecl. 11, 112-114,

immo Satanum
pessimus ex illis quos noctibus atque diebus
ter tribus in terras fama est ex aethere lapsos—

as well as the description of the fall of the Titans in Hesiod. T*

The influence of Mantuan’s Eclogues in sixteenth-century
Germany would be an interesting subject, but that must be
left to some one who has access to the necessary books.
Some traces of it may be found in the Latin eclogues of
Eobanus Hessus and Euricius Cordus.

Eobanus could claim to be a pioneer in the German field:
“primi Latias in Teutona pascua Musas Ι ducimus‚” Idyl

Eglogues are reprinted, with some notes on his sources, by J. W.

Bright and W. P. Mustard.
